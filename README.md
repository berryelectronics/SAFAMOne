##A Simple and Fast Microcontroller
###Based on the STM32F103 Microcontroller
####And the STM32duino Core, build up by Roger Clark, mrburnette, Bobc, victor_pv and many more

This Dev Board is build up around the [STM32F103RET6, a 32-BIT ARM Cortex M3 Microcontroller by STMicroelectronics](http://www.st.com/web/en/resource/technical/document/datasheet/CD00191185.pdf)

It offers a full pinout of the chip with functions, aswell as multiple pinouts of the Serial Communication Pins (SPI, I2C, I2S, UART) aswell as a direct Port for 2.4" Touchscreens and 2.8" Touchscreens.
Also it comes with a break-away Black Magic Probe Clone.

As this Project is still WIP, the schematic and the board will change. 
When the project is finished and you decide to make your own, you're doing it at your own risk. But if the Magic Black Smoke comes up, please report it to me, so i can fix it :)
